      <p>Midas Movers did a fantastic job helping me move!  They were polite, courteous, extremely careful with our belongings, and VERY professional. They were really knowledgeable about how to place the items in the truck to protect the more fragile pieces from damage.  The cost was affordable and very reasonable. I would highly recommend hiring them. Five stars!</p>

        <p>I was hesitant about hiring someone to help me with my latest move, as movers can be expensive and often take longer than needed to complete a job. Justin was incredibly efficient, reasonably priced, and an all around great person to work with. He was careful with all of my stuff and was able to figure out how to get all of the items packed safely. I would definitely call him again and recommend him to anyone moving in the Philly area!</p>

        <p>I recently helped my daughter relocate to another state.  After seeing how much she had to take with her and the size of the cargo van she rented, I was 100% certain she would have to ship a good portion of her belongings. She hired Justin to pack her cargo van. I was amazed at what he was able to accomplish. Upon arrival he quickly took stock and expressed confidence that he could fit it all in the van.  He carefully carried many boxes and several musical instruments from her apartment, expertly maneuvering three narrow, steep flights of stairs multiple times. He very efficiently loaded all of her belongings into the van (in the rain!), being very mindful of the weight and fragility of many of the items. He did an expert job of getting EVERYTHING to fit, safely balancing the cargo. I was impressed with Justin's professionalism, his commitment to doing the job right, and his skill. He is a very personable individual with a good work ethic and I would not hesitate to use his services again.</p>
